### REED London (Records of Early English Drama)

- gather documentary documents from 1100 to 1650 in England, Scotland and Wales
- 12 most powerful guilds and power structure (mayor elected)
- planning, financial documents, buildings, scaffolds, but also clean up
- wedding and parade for Katherine of Aragon

beacon to capture data attention, if such thing exists?

### LEAF

- XML TEI of REED

### LINCS Project

- connecting records (payments, tasks, ...) with event objects (wedding, christmas, ...)

there isn't a one size fits all DH project frame



Experimentation → collaboration
