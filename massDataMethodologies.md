### Why Art History Needs Data Science	

- Anita Gowers
- Paul Wilson, data scientist, capability.co

most of the brain is dedicated to analyse visual information

topic modelling: visualising thematic classification of large text documents

flowingdata.com 



Chronicle 250

- looking for anomalies without reading the numbers
- display of data affects how we understand it
- scatterplot of attendance vs exhibition length
- data needs to be tuned, it's a progress of exploring..

### Digital Humanities as a Fundamental Methodological Approach: A Case Study of the Postcard Craze

Shane Morrissy

- visualising the scale of the craze
- production analysis → ubiquity of the images
- annual reports of the post-office departement (available online
- case study 1978 - 1930 →  situates the peak of the craze at 1908 - 1913
- discrepancy between the narratives and the data: postal cards were postcards produced by the governement (before allowing private manufactured postcard) → contained pre-printed stamps
- useful aspect of mass data and archival sources available online

### Q&A

importance of visualisation in all 3 presentations: revelatory dimension to it.  What attention does each panelist give to the aesthetics of it? Off the shelf kits/palettes, working with designers..? 

- problem that they are working with off the shlef
- trying to make them look drafty

what about animation? 

- duration?
- interactions to let people tease out the significance between difference in the chart

wikidata ?

- automated searches of the ressources (bug if not)
- aspiration to connect id's with wikidata (not currently there)
- anticipate they would contribute to some authorities such as wikidata and wordcat
- partenership with getty portal, sharing data to identify authors to include in their new digitization effort

Is there a specific online exhibition software behind the chronicle250 website?

- A company called Digirati developed the website using designs by Strick and Williams. You can read more about the process here: https://cultural-heritage.digirati.com/showcasing-collections/paul-mellon-centre-chronicle-250/ You can follow links from this site to read more about the technical solutions…but overall this is a pretty bespoke project so I can’t refer you to an easy online exhibition software option via this project

postcard craze data: did you automate some of the extraction from the digitzed reports?

- no good way to automate, no standarisation at scale
- every postmaster reformats the report
