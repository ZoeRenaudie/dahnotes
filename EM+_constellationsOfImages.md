## Choreographies of (Re)Scale: the aesthecitcs of interactive tools for digitized film archives
Martine Beugnet & Lily Hibberd, LARCA 

film aesthtics
Browsing experience  → linear form (2D) in film archives

Focus on the effect of tactile and kinestetic effect of haptic interfacing
data clouds, maps or mosaïcs: regimes of vision, between hand and eye, proximity and distance, ...
online or in museum installations

Experience of the archive, functional and phenomenal way

media archaeology: continuation of technique, science and visual culture. Controllable optical devices to enhance visual capacities. User as optical hand

Changeable display of moving extracts

difference between dh app and analytical tools for scholarly research vs for broad public

think through contemporary modes of reception

aesthetics of the interface, tactility, 
haptics: zoom, pan, rescaling
spatio-navigation

film and visual archives navigation that aligns with other video forms, cinematic techniques of viewing (zoom, pan, ...)

Cloud or map
- visible manifestation of bulk
- visualisation of large archives: sheer quantity of objects in the collections
- first experience is opposite of taking control

> experience du non-savoir, Didi-Huberman

Initial experience, opposite of Leibniz phenomenal perception
- cannot identify the whole, except maybe through analogy (milky way, tapestry, ...)
- what of the surrounding space, dark shadowy background: negative space
- enclosed space and surrounding darkness: trigger imagination Deuleuze *out of field* 

navigation in large visual archives
- engaging with scale, motionlessness
- dealing with time-based media that already encompasses the kinestetics: 2 stage process


### SEMIA
[sensory moving image archive project 2017-2019](https://sensorymovingimagearchive.humanities.uva.nl/)

aimed at the general public
appearance is based on color similarity, stochastic neighbor embedding, figural content or shape, dominant composition, etc.

Zoom possible accross clusters. 
Rack-mouvement: Change of focus in the camera movement. Typical effet of pix-plot effect on 2d images.

When we click an image on screen a window frame opens.
- choose a screening mode (overlay or full screen)
- quilt assemblage of frame

Once film or extract starts playing, internal grammar takes over
Temporality and grammar takes over.

Stanley Cavell, to watch a film, succesion of frames, recognize our alienation but also recognise the resistance of images to our understanding

### Movie Catcher
[Eye Filmmuseum collection, Studio Louter 2022](https://www.studiolouter.nl/en/eye-filmmuseum-film-catcher)

interactive panoramic room: searching the collection in a non-semantic way → color, emotion, movement, to reveal unexpected similarties between cinematic fragments

Replace camera with interface in the classic quote of W Benjamin
- panoramic display
- swooping and rising, disrupting and isolating, stretching or compressing a sequence, enlarging or reducing an object

recompose the collection through various metadata categories
spatialised video montage
- dynamic effect of motion blur
- fluctuating spatial architecture of the display
- systemic reshuffling
- reconfiguring frames in layers of various sizes and ...
- ensemble of choreographic movements

shift away from stating, lineary content
non-narrative structure, recombination, remix

Navigation of digitized AV archives
> a means to navigate and consume in the infinity of supermarket villages

account for the aesthetic experience that they offer
> reformated, magnified, intensified

Multilayers form of sensation and temporalities
chaotic and unrelated data towards a digital ecology
