intro sur l'histoire des ordinateurs et des logiciels / applications

## Plan

anyOS : mac, windows, linux, android, iOS...

install on a machine, create password → sign in with other device, sync in peer to peer way

~ 1 cross plateform releases per month

milestones:

- team sovereignty: planned release 1st quarter of 2023
- open sourcing OS collectively owned and co-created: open API by end of 2022, opening layers step by step

## Fonctionnement

anything is an **object**, create new **types** and save templates

semantic core → from object to graph with **relations**

**sets** are collections of objects sharing some relations (database views with content)

## Utilisation

recovery phrase is the only key to the account (for privacy)

tech stack

- desktop: electron + typescript
- mobile: swiftt, kotlin
- network and storage: IPFS, ThreadsDB, go-lang, Libp2p <!-- à rechercher-->

objects as protobuf files on top of ipfs

Graph view

Intégrations: ex import or sync Zotero API → should be possible when the API is released. Imports should work at Beta launch

Export: html, md, pdf <!-- pas de csv??-->

calendar: maybe next year
