VKC Vlaamse Kunst Collectie - FAC Flemish art collection

New conservation and annotation tool

> Within the context of the project 'IIIF Phase 2', the Flemish Art Collection (Vlaamse Kunstcollectie or VKC) has developed a tool for automated condition reporting with annotations in IIIF for use in cultural heritage institutions, such as museums. The aim of this task was to investigate the possibilities within IIIF to make annotations, store them permanently, link a history to them and make them searchable. It was set up with and for the KMSKA (The Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp), one of our partner museums, using our VKC ecosystem. Here is a 16 minute video in English prepared by the Flemish Art Collection team presenting the project:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3ueGj8CTaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3ueGj8CTaY)
