# CDH Digital Editing/Edition projects

Deuxème séance du projet Développement partenariat "Nouvelles réflexions sur les éditions critiques en contexte numérique", CRIHN
GREN: groupe de recherche sur les éditions numériques

Jason Boyd, director of the [Centre for Digital Humanities](cdh.rula.info), Ryerson University

- Yellow Nineties 2.0
- Social edition projects (Wikisource)
- Fortune Theatre Records Prototype project
- Texting Wilde Project

## Projects

### [Yellow nineties 2.0](https://1890s.ca/)
General Editor: Lorraine Janzen Kooistra
- periodicals from the 90s
- importance of the materialy: provide different versions of these periodicals
    - Facsilime Flipbook
    - HTML version
    - XML TEI
- supplementary materials: biographies etc
- [Personography](https://personography.1890s.ca/project-exhibits/): textual communities / networks, visualize interconnections between people involved in the magazines

### Social editions
[Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- annotated edition of the text (Tales of John Olver Hobbes)
- edition of poems: photographies and facsimiles of handwritten 

If it were to be redone, would probably use [cove](https://editions.covecollective.org/).


### Fortune Theatre Records Prototype project

REED already a markup system developped by McCarthy. Find equivalent in TEI P5.
Cf. Fortune Theatre Records Prototype Digital Edition 2013 [White paper](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:33411/) avec John Bradley 

### Texting Wilde Project

- exploration of computer assisted methodologies for the study of biographical corpora
- pre-1945 biographical texts relating to Wilde

Exegesis like for the study of the Bible.
Generalogies of texts, narratives, etc. Understand Wilde as a collection corpora.

Use TEI to markup information and relate it to a critical apparatus: bibliography, chronolgy, personography. Nota use of factoïd annotations.
finding commonalities and connexions between items of the corpus
- entity cluster matches 
- matching entity cluster search
- Personography entries in an external file with the creation of an intermediate entry that is unidentified.
- sample chronology `<event>` entry. It reveals that the chronology reconstituted from the biographies is ~
  

Study of event textual transmission: 'Sigma', *Personalia* (1903), story heard about Wilde, story published 20 years later
- represent it visually, while showing the knowledge about events is highly mediated is an interesting challenge

Not to create the one biography to rule them all
Disrupt the complacency about what we think we know about Wilde
See Oscar Wilde as a textual problem of him

## Questions
Pedagogy and evaluation of work with students (wiki source editions), tips? 
- larger context: phenomena of social scolarship, what does it mean for scholarly editing as anyone can come and modify or challenge your choices ? 
- thinking about all the things that can be interlinked and tied into the project (wikidata etc.)
- Cove as better way to produce this kind of work
- evaluation: divide the text into chunks, each person responsible to edit their chunk. Kept a log of people's work on the larger edition, as a whole. Evaluate the activity and assess them on that ground

Relation between text and truth, digital methods that allow one to make differences between *regimes de vérité* 
- by showing the errors in stories, separating falshoods from the truth
- do a biographical work that goes so far that it stops, biographers would usually do all the work and then smooth out the issues with an authoritative voice. Rather confront poeple with a multivariate story, "it's up to you know what you think about the validity of the stories and evaluate their claim to reality"
- why are biographer talking about stories? to make a specific point about Woilde, what the events tell us about him. Jason would rather keep these elements undeterminate

Wiilde corporea with factoid annotations
- things that happen at a specific moment in time: date
- whole body of material that say something about Wilde's taste or preferences, but not bounded chronologically. What to do with them? 
- How to track those stories? Factoid to record those particular things about Wilde that aren't amenable to dating because it is important to track them as well

Wilde projet: not very interested in producing digital editions, rather marking them up, specific text excepts (mentionning Wilde), for analysis. 

How do you see these non traditional textual editions being reused by others? 
- perennial source of complaint: why not markup all the text but just excerpts? time, money, but also specific interest 
- approach through chronolgy to construct a *sort-of* biography, but it would still be somewhat problematic
- goal would be simply to bring together multiple versions of the same stories so that people could look at it, in the same way one can see different versions of stories

Wilde project, study of biography and posthuman technolgies
- WIle cannot be reduce to nice, simple, comprehensible figure, might fit or require a post-human biography

social editing, lessons learned? especially regarding the assignment
- wikisource has its own protocols, structure and markup, editorial principles of the platform
- each project requires its own standards and principes
- preparatory work is required before diving into the editing: allow students to learn how a platform like wikisource works
- students get an outcome
- understanding the process of edition by participating in it, understanding what annotation is for and for whom it is
- COVE have teaching essays and syllabi online
