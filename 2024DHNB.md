Postcards : multimodality (visual data, text, temporal data, personal networks, spatial dimension, Postcard as a commercial object)

[Pishu Tebe](https://pishutebe.ru/) (russian : I am writing to you)
2021-today
voluntary, non profit, no funding, no affiliations
450 people have participated in the project. 

Sources : Capta not data. Digital archives includes all postcards. 
No geo or linguistic limitations. 
Open-access images on the Internet (collectors marketplace), museums (collaboration with public and private institution), private collection. 
Database structure 

Process : 
volunteers and student interns. 
filling database : transcription and moderation
regular internships with higher school of economics
motivated interns become members of the core team. 

IT Pipeline 
assures that everything runs smoothly and data is clean. 
Postcard mining => Pre-processing => Manual mining (Mark up tool)  => post processing (verification, collect automatic mistakes correction, image tagging) => publication (open data)

Results : quantative growth of volunteers and interns. 

Data analyses

Universitetet i Oslo, Norway

A créé Takerun pour sa these sur le langage rune. 


Setback : can't run as plain texte, relational integritu; use ms access, lack of data modelling.  

Conseils : 
do not use MS ACCESS
read about different project in different disciplines. 
Experiment with their tools for a weeks or two, learn about it. If it can't do what you need, don't use it. 
Learn SQL
Explain data structuring is part of your metholodogy. is the equivalent to creating an ontology for your research subject.

title : Catalogues as Data for Computational Analysis

## Glam context

- Understand better library and archival collections (publishing trends)
- Digitisation practice and resources (LWM map/newspapers tools)
- Metadata analysis and enhancement at scale (language, subjects, genres, named entities) 
- Linked data

Examples:
[English Short Title Catalogue](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/978-3-030-54913-8_3?sharing_token=CRj3ZvG1ylBYSgwFmVnwwve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5IdNh2_buCWPbyoAi2dXLfw2eXd6cwcpU-fwVSJ4CumwZxJ9lKBfI_aDVPYwIKUuHKxXK7tsMJaBPaNJ53ZGprmsLRFdlMr8tAk0c3H2HB8LV79k0-3sFweGB50_gmcT0%3D) (Tolonen, Mikko et al.)
[British and Irish Newspapers Title List](https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/datasets/7da47fac-a759-49e2-a95a-26d49004eba8) and [Handbook](https://bookdown.org/yann_ryan/r-for-newspaper-data/introduction.html#unlocking-the-past-with-newspaper-data) (Ryan, Yann)]
[Automated Language Identification](https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/articles/6c99ffcb-0003-477d-8a58-64cf8c45ecf5) (Morris, Victoria)

## Harnessing Machine Learning and AI

- Use with new methods and tools
- Train language models
- Extract information and use crowdsourced information
- Build resources for GLAM professionals
- Facilitates computational analysis of collections

Some great examples:
[Introduction — Classifying 19th Century British Library books using Crowdsourcing and Machine Learning](living-with-machines.github.io)
[Convert a Card project and web app](https://blogs.bl.uk/digital-scholarship/2023/09/convert-a-card-past-present-and-future-of-catalogue-cards-retroconversion.html)

## Examine the outputs from automated text recognition (errors, inconsistencies, variants, punctuation, special characters/scripts)
Understand the language used by cataloguers and curators over time
Address any problematic or offensive terminology
Identify patterns in the data and research questions
Identify curatorial voices and any biases
Explore the relationships between the descriptions (items, named entities)
Explore the transmission of descriptions between catalogues and the relation to other resources
Inform the development of inclusive descriptive curatorial and cataloguing practice
Corpus linguistic method tested by https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/ 


## Transkribus

gratuit jusqu'à un certain point. 
Divided in sets because layout inconsistent. 
last version transkribus permits to train your layout model. 

Model not supported anymore so can't be transmitted. If trained data would do it different. 

question : why didn't use Epfinder ? 
answer : default setting wasn't enough because there was no it person in the team to do a special script. The template of the catalogu. Transkribus is more powerful. 

10% as to be manually put in. 

## Code development

[Github](https://github.com/britishlibrary/Incunabula-Catalogue-Entry-Detection/tree/DHNB)

[Notebook](https://hub.ovh2.mybinder.org/user/britishlibrary--entry-detection-w2t3o81k/notebooks/dhnb-incu-content-repo/notebooks/Catalogues%20as%20Data%20for%20Computational%20Analysis%20-%20DHNB%202024.ipynb)

You run the place model and then the text recognition model. 
You could run a layout model also, doing it on cards project on transkribus. 


## AntCon

https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/01-introduction/index.html

Word lists are a useful starting point for getting an overview of the linguistic features of a corpus.
Select the Word Tool and press Start to generate a word list, using the default settings.
Note the top 30 word types (over 30% of the words in the corpus)? Do all the words/strings make sense?
Select the case setting and run the query again. Note the difference.
What named entities appear in the top 200 word types? 
Click on King to explore how the word is used in the corpus. 
Select the Invert Order setting to browse the long tail of infrequently used word types. Eg. mostly Latin words some names, strings of letters. Note some of the transcription errors! 
Sort by Type to browse word types alphabetically (capitalised hits at top). Eg.  exchange (25) vs. exchanged (1)
For the domain-specific terms you may refer to this Glossary of Incunabula 
If saving the outputs of your searches, ensure the filename includes information about your corpus, query, settings, or AntConc version. You can copy and paste the results or save results from the File menu (Ctrl+S)
