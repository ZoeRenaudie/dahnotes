### Observable Can do That? 

Mike Bostock, CTO and Co-Founder, Observable

> A list of techniques to show what's possible with Observable.

### The Happiest Notebooks on Earth

https://apreshill.github.io/happiest-notebooks-on-earth

Alison Hill, Director of Knowledge, Voltron Data

> Notebooks hold a special place in every data scientist's heart. They may treasure every moment creating their own, or commenting on others' notebooks. Or they may sincerely and truly hate notebooks. But notebooks are useful. How could we "imagineer" better notebooks? I’ve made and read hundreds of notebooks in the past decade. In this talk, I'll share key principles for developing happier notebooks – ones that are more fun to write, more fun to read, and more fun as an onramp to the next ride.

### Waterlines

Olivia Vane, Interactive Data Journalist, The Economist

> Across a collection of 4 Observable notebooks, Olivia has explored how to draw and animate 'waterlines'—an old technique for showing water in maps—in JavaScript. This talk will present the project, spanning design, history, coding, and maths. Olivia will share lessons and reflections around the power of images, connecting to historical examples and writing in notebooks.

can you draw waterlines with code and add them to interactive maps online?

- get inspired by history
- don't forget about the power of aesthetics
- more computational essays (explore, explain, live code, images, input controls...)



Wow, beautiful custom HTML. View of thumbnails and details of maps makes me wonder: is there any IIIF integration with Observable?



### Build an Advanced Report from Simple Pieces

Ian Johnson, Data Visualization Developer, Observable

> In this workshop we will build an e-commerce dashboard using real data using open source components and libraries like Observable Plot, Observable Inputs and D3.jsWe will start with a simple SQL query, make it more advanced and then layer interactivity and visualization. In the end we will have something like [this report](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/which-items-are-purchased-together).



### Eurovision Results of Spanish Artists, Composers, and Lyricists by Gender

https://observablehq.com/@irenedelatorre/eurovision-data-analysis-with-plot

Irene de la Torre Arenas, Visualization Lead, UCB

> This project studies if the Spanish participation in Eurovision has been a fair representation of its society in terms of gender. It takes a special focus on the team members who, although invisible to the general audience, shape the messages that reach them: lyricists and composers.This session will show how this project was produced: from using Plot.js to make quick sketches to using Observable Cells to assemble the final website.No programming expertise is needed.

### Five Thousand Years of Graphics

Toph Tucker, Software Developer, Observable

> When you look at a menu of the kinds of chart you could make, can you guess which came first? A sprint through a hundred milestones in visualization research, from cuneiform to the computer.

#### 1. Signs, Measures, and Maps

2700 BC - 1644

Quipu, Andes

#### 2. Dawn of the Abstract Plane

1644 - 1886

earliest recognizably modern charts

Marshall Islands stick charts (documented by a missionnary): patterns of ocean swells as part of a vector field

Ammassalik wooden maps of greenland coastline (dated by colonial documentation, no inuit date)

#### 3. Expansion of Science into Statistics, Psychology, and Eugenics

1886 - 1959

Aggregations, quantifications of people, and the reflexive quantitative study of the effectiveness of quantitative visualisation

History is troublingly linked to eugenics

artists: Kandinsky, Man Ray, Picasso (connection between more abstract visualization & more abstract art).

​     

#### 4. The Computer I

1959 - 2000

Mechanical ways of seeing

PIA14032 Jet Propulsion Laboratory   (coloring the images)



#### 5. The Computer II

2000 - ...

new dawn of the abstract (dynamic) place on the personal, networked, mobile computer, with graphics as both art and interface

2007 Jeffrey Heer, George Robertson        Animated Transitions in Statistical Data Graphics

2011: D3

2016 Archie Tse: fewer interactives at NYT: readers just want to scroll

materials realities of each time inform the abstract visualisations

scrollytelling

There is a "visibility" promise available in Observable that fires when the  cell is visible. For more nuanced scrolly telling I think you'd need to  use the intersection observer browser API

Stumbled on this data physicalization timeline gallery, seems like a good complementary read: [dataphys.org/list/gallery/](http://dataphys.org/list/gallery/) :)

### Observable in the University Classroom and Research Lab

David Kirkby, Physics & Astronomy Professor, UC Irvine

> This session will provide an overview of how I use Observable in my teaching and research at the University of California, Irvine, with sample notebooks and web pages. It will help other academics understand the benefits of the platform, and give examples of engaging students and research collaborators without Observable or JavaScript experience.

### Making It Personal: Visualizing the Current State of Access to Assisted Reproductive Techniques in Europe with Observable

Carmen Torrecillas, Data Visualization, Civio

> A case study in how to convey and personalize complex data in a way that audiences can process and engage with at a glance. This session is open to anyone interested in the creative process of data visualization. We will cover workflow topics such as importing several Observable notebooks into one final piece and handling the internationalization process at the end of the project. Check out this [article ](https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2021/11/02/ART-EU-access/)on Civio.



### Observable in Higher Education: Institutional Research Use Cases

Sara Quigley, Senior Data Analyst UC Berkeley

> This session is intended for data analysts working in decentralized settings (such as a large research university) with private data (such a FERPA-protected data) in a few contexts such as ad hoc analysis, data wrangling, and building and sharing dashboards with non-technical people.  We'll walk through examples of securely loading data into Observable,  data reshaping with libraries like Arquero and iteratively building dashboards with Observable Plot and sharing them using the Teams feature.



### Show me another: How to start investigating criminal justice (and other things)

David Eads, Data Editor, The Marshall Project

> Learn how The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers the US criminal justice system,contends with messy and incomplete data. Observable notebooks and Hasura APIs power the internal tools that help us sample cases to find reporting leads and review our stories.And we'll show how those internal tools become publication-ready products. This session is for all skill levels.
