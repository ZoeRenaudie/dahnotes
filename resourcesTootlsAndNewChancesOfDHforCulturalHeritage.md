# Resources, Tools and New Chances of Digital Humanities for Cultural Heritage

Seminars series organized by Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (VeDPH), Department of Humanities, Ca’ Foscari University Venice Autumn Term, September-December 2021 - 5 p.m. CEST/CET - (The seminars will be held online as [virtual events)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsKGgmg-8kw).

20 October 2021  

Presentors

- Rita Bernini, Istituto centrale per la grafica
- José María Luzón Nogué, Universidad Complutense de Madrid
- Maria Cristina Misiti, independent scholar

Abstract: *The project we present has two clearly defined aspects. It basically consists on the use of a newly developed software for the presentation and management of art collections. On the one hand, we use a database where all kinds of multimedia files can be downloaded. On the other hand, we have developed a book format in order to make accessible a linear reading of its contents incorporating multimedia files as well. As part of the scientific collaboration between the Real Academia de Bellas Artes in Madrid and the Istituto centrale per la grafica in Rome we present an example of its collection database. As a multimedia book, the recently edited "Giambattista Piranesi - "Sognare il sogno impossibile" published on the occasion of the third centenary of the Venetian architect will be analysed.*

## Presentation

### José María Luzón

[multimedia book](https://www.numanciamultimedia.com/), mai 2018 

- working with new images (vector & 3D images), can't be included in a paper book
- new ways to edit: blog, website (to navigate)
- write a book that has to be read in a linear manner, without page but with chapters. 
- be read in many ways, download etc

How to organise it? possibility to download the file and study it

- 3D images

[database](https://www.academiacolecciones.com/)

- what can be added to a normal database? All the developped material (3D images, links)
- enrich the database : cumulate years of research, it becomes a tool as you can download it (maps, photogrammetry, sound)

### Maria Cristina Misiti

[Piranese multimediale](https://piranesimultimediale.it/piranesi/en), Multimedia work dedicated to Gianbattista, mai 2021

Piranese: architect, designer, artist of the XVIIIe 

inspiration Umberto Eco 

- *techno-enthousiast*: interest and curiosity about the world 
- ability to see the new before others, to the point to grasping trends and social phenomena in advance
- ways in which the internet intervenes in the process of knowledge, modifying the behaviors and habits of readers, to the point of structurally affecting the ability to read, to store and decode knowledge
- "technology can give Man the dizzying illusion of capturing with a gesture, a clic, the essence of things, the proud joy of speed and ease of access, standardizing creative practices such as reading and writing, intelligence is therefore creative because it is litterally *arts combinatoria*"

web invites to a multifocal, multiverse, sometimes redundant reading, which encourages to consider the knowledge in an integral sense

multimedia narrative: 

- multilingual, various backgrounds
- coomplexe narrative that unfolds through links, recalls and various keys offered to the reader as they move through the contents 
- explore the potential of the web to convey cultural content in an innovative way

more than a book, it's a virtual library that concentrates multiple forms of communication and that will allow the reader to know and study of Piranese

- deepen history and background, creating visual maps with events, characters and ideas 
- discovering otherwise hidden relationships between several fields of knowledge

implementation of interoperability with other institutions, facing the imperative responsibility to transform ourselves from simple user-consumer to creator of our own knowledge, cooperating with a vigilant, conscious and proactive attitude to the processes of cultural production

instituto centrale per la grafica: wanted to make the database available for scholars (images and critical cards)

open access for scientific publications has made it possible for the world of research and academic libraries to share scientific knowledge without economic, legal or technological barriers

digital humanities are taking a real epistemological turn, defined as *knowledge design*

- digital elaboration of cultural contents that revitalize textual data in the light of a project that exploits digital technologies
- going beyond the simple publication of books, new scientific paradigm that overcomes the traditional separation of knowledge with a new design approach
- goal was not the electronic edition of a book, project corresponds to the need for open, free and easily accessible communication

multimedia book *numancia*

- model to manage in a logical manner text, images, animation, drawings, databases etc.
- placement of files is made for the reader to access all of them



### Rita Bernini

[calcographica](https://www.calcografica.it/) 

presenting the features of the new digital archive of the heritage fo the intituto centrale per la grafica  

rethinking activities of the institute in light of the health emergency

insituto: 

- public collection of drawings, prints, metallic and wood plates, and photographs
- under the responsability of the italian ministry of cultural heritage
- 120'000+ prints from renaissance to present day
-  26'000 old master drawings, european graphic arts, 16th to 19th century, with a clear majority of italian artists
- 24'000 plates of copper, zinc, lead, steel, brass, wood, linoleum, cardboard ...
- 17'000 old photographs, contemporary and older techniques, from mid 19th century to present day

digital database is not complete, still in progress, started to add and edit contents

- 300'000+ records related to an artwork preserved in their collection
- scientific and historical data complied over more than 30 years
- began when digital technologies where still rather elementary, and not yet developed as they are today
- the scientific data coming from this *primitive* cataloguing campaign have been transferred to more and more developed formats and to increasingly performing applications, but they had become outdated 

 Instituto signed a collaboration protocol with the Real academia des artes san Fernando, Madrid: recover the data and make it more accessible for users with a new application plateform by the spanish real academia
