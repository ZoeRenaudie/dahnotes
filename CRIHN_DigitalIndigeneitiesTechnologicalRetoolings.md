# Digital indigeneities, technological retoolings
retooling

Genner Llanes-Ortiz (Bishop’s University)
Canada Research Chair – [Digital Indigeneities](https://www.ubishops.ca/canada-research-chair-for-sociology-departments-dr-genner-llanes-ortiz-digital-indigeneities/)

*[Digital Indigeneities: (Re)mediations, Old and New](https://ais.illinois.edu/research/symposia-and-features/digital-indigeneities)*, Fall Symposium, September 13-14, 2013


Discussion happening in english-speaking context (New Zealand, Canada, US...)
What kind of new ways of knowing would be embedded in new technologies ? 


Multimodality
> Kinship [between] digital media and indigenous cultural practices
> Armida de la Garza, *[Aboriginal digitalities; Indigenous Peoples and New Media](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40953-5_3)* 2016
- archetype of Indigenous orality but record keeping happened too, many forms of media creatively used, haptic written languages with no separations or hierarchy of knowledge (ie arts vs science etc)
- use of pictographic writing (hieroglyphics)


The internet as assemblage, Ramesh Srinivasan and Adam Fish
- critical point of view on Internet utopia as a radically autonomous and de-territorialized place
- [After the internet](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/After+the+Internet-p-9781509506187) 2017
- Ref à Guattari et Deleuze
- how technologies come to be embedded in political contexts where Indigenous people are in fight for survivance (?) + resistance + constant process of transformations in context of colonialisation
- assemblange → emphasize how indigenous communities adapt to technologies but also transform them as they use them

[Lenguas indigenas](https://rising.globalvoices.org/lenguas/)
- Latin American context : inequality and irregular access to internet but creative use of technologies
- importance of whatsapp in the life of people outside the global North → access to doctor, prescription, religious and other forms of socialisation
- importance to zoom in on the daily uses and unexpected forms of adaptation and transformation that happen in daily life

How do indigenous forms of expression becomme visible?

Digital exclusion
- chart of language presence on the internet, made from statistica (https://fr.statista.com/ ? )

Heritage and Media
Indigenous scholars and activists use digital media and platforms for different purposes:
1. Lanugage promotion and revitalisation
2. Dissemitation of educational materials
3. Returning ethnographic and audiovisual media to the communities
4. Re-examination of historical, ethnographic, linguistic and archaelogical information
5. Mobilisation of artistic, academic and political and personal expression
<!-- is this in order? which are most present, most lacking, or not there at all? -->

Digital "repatriation"
> devolution / Return of externally stored data, cultural resources and/or research to Indigenous publics and communities

Re-examining Heritage
- no official media (unlike cbc with "présence autochtone")
- happens on youtube, tiktok (eg: palomariro)
- critical examining that happens, which is also diverse in terms of generations
- social media as school for young maya people to learn hieroglyphic writing → requires innovation because the langage is no longer spoken

Multiplying voices
- proliferation of Indigenous voices, scholarship and opinions → opening up conversations and debates
- increases the diversity of representation of Indigenous experiences and the many ways of being one in the 21st century

Participatory heritage
- co-creating space online → premise of shared authority
- created by non-experts
- disruption to knowledge represented by media and produced by experts
- *[Participatory heritage](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/participatory-heritage/7F6CB1E949850120CB4F12FF7FD25671)*, Roued-Cunliffe & Copeland
can one measure such participatory initiatives? 

Digital Mapping
[Digital Mapping and Indigenous](https://www.routledge.com/Digital-Mapping-and-Indigenous-America/Hess/p/book/9780367272173) America Hess 2021
- introduces a wide range of projects
- yet mapping indigenous territories and cultural heritage digitally involves a new series of challenges
    - concerning situated and embodied knowledge (unmappability, however digital or interactive)
    - concerning data sovereignty and repatriation
    - concerning "collaborative and respectful stewardship"
    how to be sure that such knowledge will not impact negatively indigenous or marginalised communities? 

Indigenous Digital Futures
1. the appropriation of digital technologies and social media by Indigenous peoples should not be suprising (strategy for survival since colonial era)
2. increasing protagonism in reclaiming cultural knowledge and self-representation deservces further attention and support
3. challenges that need to be addressed: 
    - questions about "intellectual property" and multural (mis)appropriation
    - questions about personal and social safety
    - questions about authorised voices and Indigenous (virtual) public spheres


Digital retoolings
- from the emphasis on text towards the use of multimodality
- invest in and link more research and technological development through Indigenous perspectives
- maintain the link between technologiy and the comumunity to protect the knowledge of Indigenous elders & specialists
- guarantee the right of Indigenous peoples and their communities to benefit from technological advances, in accordance with their objectives and aspirations

## Questions

importance of voice messages → also some things / languages that can't be writtten or not easily typed
- different perception of formality of language (prefer text to email)
- memes, stickers etc... : activist starting to create their own forms (adding another level of multimodality)

Using indigenous data such as the NativeLand API? use it or don't? how to proceed when it comes to larger datasets, about several communities? also, what steps to make sure that it won't impact communities negatively? 
- they recommend that whatever use of the dataset, to consult with the communities
- challenges in doing that → time investment that is required, wait if there are worries
- consultation and consent: relationship with the nations is the most important thing

who do we rely on? authority of the elders, but also some that were "brainwashed by Ottawa"
- it is important to be cautious but not to fixate identities nor landscapes (key is relationality)
- for some nations: mapping as important tool to exercise and state their claims to the land
- for more disputed areas, there are endless (&very violent) conflicts that come from that


<!-- wampum as hypertext-->

<!-- do you try and document all these initiatives happening on social media and how? -->

<!-- most exambples seemed to be self-representation; how to do you see this with regard to content produced by non-indigenous peoples? -->

Notes - rencontre avec Joel

pourquoi pas un iphone pro ? pour faciliter le travail des étudiant·e.s
éclairage professionnel? 
micro → zoom

brancher le micro dans la caméra (plus simple mais moins de qualité)

pas un micro idéal pour les entrevues, trop shotgun (longue distance, perche cinema; canon plus court pour moins prendre de réverbérations), deander à serge fortin

est-ce que la caméra est capable de recevoir un embranchement du miro directement? sinon double-système où il faudra synchroniser

éclairage, ça complique toujours les choses


kit au labo cine media (10'000$)
- camera photo reflexe avec deux objectifs


juste un caméscope avec entrée son → 5 à 6000$, min 3000$ + batteries + trépied

quelle est la durée des entrevue? → quel type de batterie et combien? 
batterie (del = petites lumières, se met à baisser au fur et à mesure et on ne s'en rend pas compte tout de suite) ou éclairage qui se branche, s'il se branche il faut une rallonge / accès à une prise
si maximum 3h => 


il faut des cartes mémoires → on n'en a pas dans le budget en ce moment. en moyenne 128G donne 1h30 2h, coûte 00$ la carte il en faudrait 2

combiner achat téléphone / caméra / caméscope ? iphone 
est-ce qu'on a besoin de deux appareils pour filmer en même temps

acheter un forfait mobile parce qu'on sauverait des coûts? 

mode documentaire (éclairage de base + 1 caméra) ou entrevue (2 cam, 2 personnes)
plus réaliste le mode documentaire

possibilité que Joel forme un étudiant, qui peut rédidger un guide, qu'on pourra ensuite corriger et diffuser lors de l'emprunt du matériel
