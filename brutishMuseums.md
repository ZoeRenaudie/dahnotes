## Reflexions around the Brutish museums

[*The Brutish Museums. The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution*](https://umontreal.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1229042234) 2020, University of Oxford

### Decolonising and Museums

- *Decolonization is not a metaphor*, Eve Tuck, K. Wayne Yang 2012
- *The wretched of the Earth*, Frantz Fanon 1961
- Césaire

Samaya Kassim, *the museum will not be decolonised*, [mediadiversified](https://mediadiversified.org/2017/11/15/the-museum-will-not-be-decolonised/)

> I do not want to see decolonisation  become part of Britain’s national narrative as a pretty curio with no  substance – or, worse, for decoloniality to be claimed as yet another  great British accomplishment: *the* *railways*, *two world wars, one world cup, and decolonisation.*

Pitt Rivers - *[The Evolution of Culture](https://archive.org/details/evolutionofcultu00pitt)* 1874-1875

> nearly all the weapons used by the Australians to show hypothetically their derivation from a single form

theory is based on violence

*Rhodes must fall Ox* movement @RMF_Oxford

> Pitt-Rivers museum is one of the most violent spaces in Oxford

At that time, the museum felt pretty good about themselves

- had restituted objects
- hosted events and activities

Art and culture were put to work to make certain colonial views last: 

- durational forms of art
- once you put up an exhibition or a monument, it's incredibly difficult to take them down

Cecil Rhodes statue, Oriel College, Oxford

Benin case

- objects that were taken with violence
- violence is told and retold as they open their doors <!-- novel way of seeing the space for the curator-->
- display cases are another tool in the armoury, in the tactic of war that sought a claim to sovereignty; to the destruction of religion and ancestral history; cultural dispossession to create a ground zero  
- speed at which the objects were stolen and the exhibited
- objects were put into the room with bronze age: we are taking your culture and sticking it into the bronze age

1894:

- openin of pitts museum
- division of Africa to European nations
- invention of the machine gun : culture model based on weaponery

Benin 1897

- punitive expedition
- did not happen in a colony (European nations did not loot their colonies); different forms of colonialism: militarist extractivist form of colonialism that went with company land and protectorate land → Royal Niger Company / Niger Coast Protectorate (palm oil & rubber)
- 10'000 objects looted, 1200 bronze plaques + brass sculptures, carved ivory tusks, coral work, ivory, wood, metal

Movement for restitution for the 100 year anniversary, including by Bernie Grant MP

### What does it look like for the museum
